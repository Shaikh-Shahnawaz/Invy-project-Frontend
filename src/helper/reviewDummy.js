    description: ` My therapist Jamna is just great in her job. It was my second
    session for full body hair removal. She made me feel sooo
    comfortable and relaxed. Jamna really is very kind and soft
    spoken and helped me alot with my skin's acne issues as well.
    Throughout the session she made sure I wasn't experiencing any
    discomfort. I did not feel any pain and literally slept while
    the session thanks to painless hair removal and Jamna's
    expertise. Skin feels so soft and smooth now. Thank you so
    much☺️ Also, she take utmost care with respect to corona
    protocol. Proper hygiene and safety were maintained. She
    consulted the dermatologist as well before starting the process
    and changed the machine temperature, etc. according to my skin
